**Abstract**

_This paper explains the implementation of SDK Extensions working together with the Clarifai SDKs. Extensions are software modules that can register themselves against the SDK and allow the SDK to function is ways not feasible without them. Extensions must conform with with a software interface, by which the SDK can invoke functions, send/receive data, and notify of events. During the lifecycle of a call to the SDK, an extension can be invoked when certain operations will, are, or did take place._

_The expansion in functionality of the SDK, via extensions, also allows for the entire system to function as a marketplace; a mediating agent between two or more transacting actors, and create a new product category in the AI space._
