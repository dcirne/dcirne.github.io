**Abstract**

_This paper takes a data aware approach to analyzing the impact of interruptions and incidents on the productivity of the engineering team, examines the components of a task and the importance of a minimum layer of processes, and concludes with the proposal of a framework to cultivating a sustainable high output team._

**Introduction**

We all know that interruptions have an impact on productivity. Meetings, context switching, bugs from tech debt1, etc. All of those affect, in a negative way, the production capacity of a team. Our personal suspicions are probably many about how much or to what extent things are affected. However, those are just our opinions, our gut feeling. Instead, could it measure, quantify, and model the data to have a deeper insight?

This is the motivation behind this paper. A study quantifying the impact of the various interruptions, incidents, context switching, meetings, and other interferences that cause a decay in the productivity of the teams, and a look at things that can be done to mitigate the effects of such incidents.
