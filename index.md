This is a place where I keep a collection of papers, thoughts, and short essays.

### Engineering Velocity: Cultivating a sustainable high output team

**Jul 2019**

This paper takes a data aware approach to analyzing the impact of interruptions and incidents on the productivity of the engineering team, examines the components of a task and the importance of a minimum layer of processes, and concludes with the proposal of a framework to cultivating a sustainable high output team.

### Engineering Culture Manifesto

**Jan 2019**

Culture is not organic, it is cultivated. It ought to be built on top of a foundation, only then be open to diverse points of view and suggestions. These are the fundamental pillars of engineering culture. ([Continue reading...](engineering_culture_manifesto.md))

### Convergence Rank And Its Applications

**Sep 2016**

In this paper, we explore an algorithm to determine the relevance of each item in a finite set of items in reference to each other to address an item you have to first go through a convergence or proxy item. If we imagine a media streaming company (convergence item) and all its available genres for playback (items in a finite set), how relevant is each music genre at different moments in time? Or with a sports broadcasting company and the covered sports, how does the relevance of each sport changes throughout the year as sports seasons begin and end?

### ARGEOM - Augmented Reality Geolocation Math

**May 2013**

Augmented reality combined with modern day smartphones equipped with cameras, magnetometers, and with the ability to display maps on the screen make a powerful tool that can be used in a plethora of different applications. This paper explores the math that goes behind such apps and the implementation of a completely functional project. ([Continue reading...](argeom.md))
