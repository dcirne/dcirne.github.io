## Engineering Velocity: Cultivating a sustainable high output team

**Jul 2019**

This paper takes a data aware approach to analyzing the impact of interruptions and incidents on the productivity of the engineering team, examines the components of a task and the importance of a minimum layer of processes, and concludes with the proposal of a framework to cultivating a sustainable high output team.

## Engineering Culture Manifesto

**Jan 2019**

Culture is not organic, it is cultivated. It ought to be built on top of a foundation, only then be open to diverse points of view and suggestions. These are the fundamental pillars of engineering culture. ([Continue reading...](engineering_culture_manifesto.md))

## SDK Extensions

**May 2018**

> Original text, and appendix, to the U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No.:62/741,122

This paper explains the implementation of SDK Extensions working together with the Clarifai SDKs. Extensions are software modules that can register themselves against the SDK and allow the SDK to function is ways not feasible without them. Extensions must conform with with a software interface, by which the SDK can invoke functions, send/receive data, and notify of events. During the lifecycle of a call to the SDK, an extension can be invoked when certain operations will, are, or did take place. ([Continue reading...](sdk_extensions.md))

## Convergence Rank And Its Applications

**Sep 2016**

In this paper, we explore an algorithm to determine the relevance of each item in a finite set of items in reference to each other to address an item you have to first go through a convergence or proxy item. If we imagine a media streaming company (convergence item) and all its available genres for playback (items in a finite set), how relevant is each music genre at different moments in time? Or with a sports broadcasting company and the covered sports, how does the relevance of each sport changes throughout the year as sports seasons begin and end?

## ARGEOM - Augmented Reality Geolocation Math

**May 2013**

Augmented reality combined with modern day smartphones equipped with cameras, magnetometers, and with the ability to display maps on the screen make a powerful tool that can be used in a plethora of different applications. This paper explores the math that goes behind such apps and the implementation of a completely functional project. ([Continue reading...](argeom.md))


## Multithreading - An extensive study on Linux, OpenSolaris, and Windows

**Apr 2010**

There are many reasons why one may choose a particular operating system to run on their computer: availability of software, technical skills, etc. Among those reasons one may choose the operating system with the best performance, or the one with the lowest cost per transaction. This paper examines three operating systems (Linux, OpenSolaris, and Windows) and their respective capabilities of taking advantage of the multiple cores present in modern processors by executing operations with integers, floating points and math, and I/O in a multithreaded way, achieving parallelism in the execution of those operations, and then tries to reason the measurements from the experiments in the economics of an operating system.
